# Banglor House Price Prediction.
This is a project of a apartment in which there are different type of flats according to their "BHK, area of room and different prices". so, I am predicting the price of different flats according to their prices from which the clients can easily get the flats according to their budgets. 
In this Project, I have used the Linear Regression algorithm, and for erroe checking I have used the Mean Squre Error Method.
Dataset is "Banglor House Price Prediction".
